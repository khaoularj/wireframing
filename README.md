# wireframing

## Introduction
Wireframing is the creation of simple, low-fidelity layouts to outline the structure and functionality of a user interface (UI). It serves as a blueprint for the design process.

## Importance
- Provides clarity on UI layout and functionality.
- Enables collaboration between team members.
- Identifies potential issues early, saving time and effort.

## Key Elements of Wireframing
1. **Layout Structure**
Defines the overall arrangement of elements on a page, ensuring a clear hierarchy and flow.
Example:
A grid-based structure organizes content into sections like header, body, and footer for consistency and readability.

2. **Navigation**
Represents how users move between pages or sections.
Example:
A top navigation bar with links to "Home," "About," and "Contact" guides users effectively.

3. **Content Placement**
Outlines where text, images, and other content elements will appear.
Example:
Placing a prominent headline and call-to-action (CTA) button above the fold grabs users' attention immediately.

4. **Functionality**
Indicates interactive elements and their intended behavior.
Example:
Buttons for actions like "Sign Up" or "Book Now" and placeholders for dynamic content, such as search bars or dropdown menus.

## Types of Wireframes
1. **Low-Fidelity Wireframes**:
  Basic sketches focusing on structure and layout without visual details.
  Use: Early stages to brainstorm and communicate ideas quickly.
  Example: Grayscale layout with placeholders for text and buttons.

2. **High-Fidelity Wireframes**:
  Detailed designs closer to the final look, including colors and typography.
  Use: Later stages to refine details and gather user feedback.
  Example: Polished layout with styled navigation and interactive elements.
